# 🖋️ Handwritten Digit Recognition

> Machine Learning project for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

### > 📋 Description

This project focuses on developing and implementing three classification models to recognize handwritten digits from a modified **MNIST** dataset, containing grayscale images of the digits **0, 1, 4, and 5**. This is a classic problem in computer vision, fundamental for applying machine learning techniques.

### > 🧩 Project Overview

- [x] `Dataset`: The modified MNIST dataset consists of **28x28 pixel** grayscale images (totaling **784 pixels** per image). Each pixel represents a grayscale intensity ranging from **0 (white)** to **255 (black)**. The dataset is stored in CSV format, where the first column indicates the corresponding digit, and the remaining columns contain pixel values.
- [x] `Dimensionality Reduction`: To improve efficiency, dimensionality reduction techniques were applied, extracting two key features:
  - **Image Intensity**
  - **Symmetry**
- [x] `Classification Models`: Three linear machine learning models were implemented:
  - **Perceptron**
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Logistic Regression**
- [x] `Evaluation`: Model performance is assessed based on classification accuracy, allowing comparisons between different approaches.
